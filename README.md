# 100 Days of Agile

This is the repository for the path of 100 days of Agile. The contents of this repository will be updated daily from the work done daily. The commitment is to spend at least one hour a day. The objective of this repository is to have a path to follow when trying to organize a team following Agile patterns and practices. The result of the work done here will be the source for articles and information that will be posted in Twitter, Linkedin and my personal blog.

## Practical Advice

### Piecemeal Groth
- Pick a pattern, apply them one at a time!
- Ongoing repair rather than forecasting and anticipating. Design of pattern based on feedback. Nature works in the now, with feedback, emploting repair.
- Don' change more than 3 things at a time. Culture can change, but it loves stability.
- Function Owner and Component Owner honors the tradition of giving focus to the marketable item anf guards the stability of the system
- Domain Expertise in Roles, helps to build foundations around core competencies rather than market fads
- Each pattern is an foreign element and upsetting event
- 6 Step (The Nature Order, Alexander 2003), The Fundamental Process:
    1. Get a feeling of the organization as a whole, how it is working, weak spots. After applying a new pettern, what is unresolved?
    2. Focus on incrementing personal and corporate values. What is affecting the goals. Reflection to focus in recurring issues. Avoid reacting to immediate concerns.
    3. Find a place where the appication of the pattern, will achieve the goal. Don't get stuck in pattern tunnel vision.
    4. Apply the pattern or technique locally, but in a way that might increase the wholeness at the next level
    5. Strive for Balance. Look for symetry between both sides of communication. (how?)
    6. Reflect. Does it feel right? If not, back out.
- Making changes during a cosciously planned retrospective helps avoid making decisions in the heat of battle
- Introduce changes between development cycles instead of in the middle
- Apply introspection and communicate results

## Patterns

### Development Episode (can be implemented overnight)

- If we overwmphasize a member's specific strenght, we diminish everyone's general abilities. It creates ambiguity as who is responsible for non-specialized tasks and discorage the learning of new skills
- Appproach all development as a group activity (as inf no han had enything else to do). Energy will build up to a decision-making climax and then the purpose should be clear, knowns explored and unknowns identified. Individual strenghts will merge in common consciousness.
- Do not steal the "Ah Ha"


### Illegitimus non-interruptus


### Sacrifice one man

## Case Studies

## Next Actions for the team
- [] Let one developer, one tester per card (except in the code review)
- [] Calculate Velocity
- [] Calculate capacity from Velocity and set WIP limits
- [] Calculate interruption capacity
- [] Implement Sacrifice one man
- [] How to apply Development Episode?
